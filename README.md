## Sorting algorithms

### Simple sorts
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
### Efficient sorts
- Quick sort (recursive)
- Merge sort (recursive)

## Search algorithms
- Binary search

## Recursive algorithms
- Factorial
- Fibonacci number for n<sup>th</sup> position
- Greatest common divisor

## Graphs
- Undirected graph representation (adjacency list)
- Deep-first search

## Project Euler
- Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5
- Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers
- Problem 3: Largest prime factor
